1. Scanning Pattern:
   - Users spend 80% of the time viewing the left half of a page
   - The more things change, the more user stay the same. 
   - Add heading and subheadings for structured scanning.
   - Show keywords and key points early in your headings to improve scanning.
   - F-Shape Pattern: Users start at the top left, read a few lines, and then start to scan vertically. 
     Users first read horizontally, then read less and less until they start scanning vertically. The first lines of text and the first words on each line receive more attention.
   - Layer-Cake Pattern: Users scan consistently across headings, with deliberate jumps into body text in between.
   - Love at First Sight Pattern: Users are often “satisficers,” searching for what’s good enough, not exhaustive enough. In search results, they often fixate on a single result.
   - Lawn-Mower Pattern: In tables, users start in the top left cell, move to the right until the end of the row, and then drop down to the next row, moving in the same pattern.
   - Spotted Pattern: Skipping big chunks of text and focusing on patterns. Often happens in search when users look for specific words, shapes, links, dates, and so on.
   - Marking Pattern: Eyes focus in one place as the mouse scrolls or a finger swipes. Common on mobile more than on desktop.
   - Bypassing Pattern: Users deliberately skip the first words of the line when multiple lines start with the same word.
   - Commitment Pattern: Reading the entire content, word by word. Happens when users are highly motivated and interested. Common for older adults.
