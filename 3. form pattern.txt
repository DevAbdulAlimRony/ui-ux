1. Live or Inline Validation:
   - Avoid Premature Validation (When User Focus or Type)
   - As it turns out in usability testing, users sincerely appreciate both — the live validation and the late validation — if things go perfectly smoothly. 
   - Live validation always interrupts users, often kicks in too early or too late, isn’t reliable enough
   - Late validation almost always performs better. It’s just that by validating late, we can be more confident that the user isn’t still in the process of typing the data in the input field.
   - Validate Empty Fields Only On Submit
   - Reward Early, Punish Late: if a user edits an erroneous field, we should be validating immediately, removing the error message and confirming that the mistake has been fixed as soon as possible .
     However, if the input was valid already and it is being edited, it’s probably better to wait until the user moves to the next input field and flag the errors then 
   -  Add the Clean Up Feature when user Copy Paste if Need for Validation (like bd phone number he copied 00170, we remove first 0 and notify him)
   - Allow Users to Override Live Validation if Need (Got Error, But say If You are sure continue with your input)
   - For Short Forms, Consider Validation on Submit Only
   - Live Validation seems to be most effective when mistakes are common and quite severe. Ex:  a password strength meter.
   - With just-in-time validation, reward-early-punish-late-pattern and validating on submit, we avoid unnecessary distractions, complex logic and layout shifts altogether, and communicate errors without annoying users too early or too late.

2. Some Form UI:

   - 

3. Filter Pattern:
   - Not enough proper filters and users shoot way over the comfortable range; too many filters and users end up with zero-results and abandon the site altogether.
   - Avoid Tiny Scrollable Panes. An alternative option would be to show as many as 7–10 options at a time with an accordion that would expand and show all options on tap/click
   - Can use Autocomplete together when Options are too many (https://bt.rozetka.com.ua/blenders/c80155/napryagenie-v163344=1551960;price=4538-8999;producer=bosch,braun,domotec/)
   - Always Provide Text Input Fallback For Sliders (lik we give price range slider, also provide input box for manually input price)
   - Never Freeze The UI On A Single Input. An obvious alternative is to hand over the decision to the user about when the results should be updated. That could mean adding an “Apply” button.
     But it’s not necessarily the only option. Actually, as it turns out, we can do both: seeing up-to-date results while interacting with the filter without any delay. We just need to move from synchronous display of results to its asynchronous counterpart.
   - Always Show Results Asynchronously
   - Avoid Layout Shifts On Filter Input
   - Display Filter Results overview and also clear button for each and clear all filter button above the results.
   - you could even use floating filters, so as a customer scrolls down the page, the filters are still accessible all the time.
   - Show The Number of Results On The “Apply” Button (https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s6/producttype/nutritional-supplements-3193?filter=off%3DRetail%7CInStock%2C18989%3D315669%7C333546%7C3967%7C351983%7C304251%7C336452%7C2528045%2C7089%3D940554%7C664811%7C940553%7C5499)
   - Always add steppers (+/-) and text input fields when using sliders

4. Better Error Message:
   - Slip error is: User want to do a thing, but do another. T prevent this error, we can use recovery suggestions, suffix/prefix, forgiving format
   - Mistake occurs when there is a mismatch between the mental model of a user and the system. To prevent, confirm destructive actions, set expectations
     early on, allow users to change their mind, always provide a way out.
   - Due to color vision deficiencies, it’s a good idea to always complement error messages with an icon
   - Thick Vertical Red Line can be used at Left Side or That type of Common Indicator for your whole Site.
   - Error Summary is a Good Idea. That summary can contain links to the areas in the form which contain errors, so users can jump there directly.
   - The summary can appear on the top of the page, or just above the action button. Never place it under the button.
   - Avoid Auto-Scrolling and Auto-Jumps
   - Displaying error messages above input fields typically helps us avoid the accessibility issues
   - Provide Examples Of Correct Input

5. Authentication:
   - Don't Disable Copy Paste for Password, use autocomplete='new-password', so browsers can prompt a strong auto-generated.
   - Any Kind of Two Factor Authentication is better than Passwords.
   - Check Password Strength (Ex. One lowercase, One Uppercase, One Number, One Special Character, 8 Chars Minimum)
   - For Social Sign in, We can tell user which he used previous to Log in.
   - It’s not a good idea to send randomly generated passwords via email and require a new password setup when a user finally manages to log in. That’s not secure, and it’s always a hassle. Instead, yet again, nudge users towards a 2FA setup, so they can recover access by accessing a code from the app installed on their phone or SMS
