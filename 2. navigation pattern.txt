1. Navigation for Mobile: we often think about hamburger menus, full-page overlays, animated slide-in-menus, and a wide range of nested accordions. Not all of these options perform well
   - Avoid too many icons guiding users in too many directions.
   - Another way to indicate multiple levels of nesting is by adding different types of icons to make it more obvious where users currently are or different design for each level
   - Don’t Overload Your Navigation With Multiple Actions (like menu- submenu, You clicked menu icon for submenu and also if menu clicked it will go to another page. Rather than, menu link provide in submenu)
   - Use the Billboard Pattern for Top Tasks or for More Important Menu
   - A slide-in menu is an option but rarely the best one.
   - The Navigation Stack Works For Quick Jumps
   - Use Curtain Pattern To Show Multiple Levels of Navigation
   - We could also add navigation queries to ask users about their intent, and allow them to choose a topic relevant to them. Think about it as a mini-search engine for your navigation, designed as a seamless autocomplete experience. 
   - Whenever possible, make links obvious by underlining them.

   - Tap-Ahead Autocomplete Pattern: We could drive users directly to relevant categories, specific products, brands, or even collections of items or records that we’ve prepared ahead of time.
